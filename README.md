# The-Dijkstra-Way

In this project, I was tasked to implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm in Java to compute the shortest paths in a directed graph from a given start node. This method should return a mapping of node names to their shortest distances using a priority queue for efficient processing. I also tried to find a way to modify the Node class to store distance information. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of graph traversal, priority queues, and shortest-path algorithms in Java. ðŸš€
